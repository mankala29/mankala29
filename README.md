                                                    ## Hi there, I’m Sweta 👋

**Software Engineer (Product Strategy) | Data Engineer | Platform & Analytics**

I build data and software systems that are reliable, scalable, and actually useful.
My sweet spot sits at the intersection of **data engineering, product thinking, and platform design** — turning complex systems into things teams can trust and move fast with.

### 🧠 What I do
- Design and build **data platforms** using Snowflake, Databricks, Kafka, and Spark  
- Work on **product-facing engineering problems** with a strong focus on strategy and impact  
- Translate business problems into **clean, maintainable technical solutions**  
- Care deeply about data quality, governance, and long-term system health

### 🔭 I'm currently working on 
Exploring how **data platforms and product engineering intersect** and building systems that scale without becoming nightmares.

✨ I believe great engineering is calm, intentional, and built to last.
