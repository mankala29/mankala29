<h2>Hi there, I’m Sweta 👋</h2>

<strong>Software Engineer (Product Strategy) | Data Engineer | Platform & Analytics</strong>

</div>

<br/>

**I build data and software systems that are reliable, scalable, and actually useful.**  
My sweet spot sits at the intersection of **data engineering, product thinking, and platform design** — turning complex systems into things teams can trust and move fast with.


### 🧠 What I do
- Build and shape data systems that enable faster product iteration and trustworthy decision-making  
- Work on **product-facing engineering problems** with a strong focus on strategy and impact  
- Translate business problems into **clean, maintainable technical solutions**  
- Care deeply about data quality, governance, and long-term system health

### 🔭 I'm currently working on
Exploring how **data platforms and product engineering intersect** and building systems that scale without becoming nightmares.

✨ *I believe great engineering is calm, intentional, and built to last.*
